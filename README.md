# Implementation of Ridge, Lasso, and ElasticNet Regularization for Predicting Car Price

## AIM:
To implement Ridge, Lasso, and ElasticNet regularization models using polynomial features and pipelines to predict car price.

## Equipments Required:
1. Hardware – PCs
2. Anaconda – Python 3.7 Installation / Jupyter notebook

## Algorithm
### 1.Import Libraries:
      Import the required libraries.

Load Dataset:
Load the dataset into the environment.

Data Preprocessing:
Handle missing values and encode categorical variables.

Define Features and Target:
Split the dataset into features (X) and the target variable (y).

Create Polynomial Features:
Generate polynomial features from the data.

Set Up Pipelines:
Create pipelines for Ridge, Lasso, and ElasticNet models.

Train Models:
Fit each model to the training data.

Evaluate Model Performance:
Assess performance using the R² score and Mean Squared Error (MSE).

Compare Results:
Compare the performance of the models.
